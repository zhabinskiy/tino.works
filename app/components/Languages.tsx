        I&apos;ve been always going back and forth between design and
        development throughout my career, until I realized that I don&apos;t
        have to choose one over another. It&apos;s just simply how I see the
        modern tech: the one can&apos;t survive without the other.

      <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        For the languages and technologies, I wasn&apos;t intentionally trying
        to fit into full-stack role, but that&apos;s definitely where I found
        myself eventually.
